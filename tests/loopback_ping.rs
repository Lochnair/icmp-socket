//! On-the-wire smoke test that validates the datagram receive path against a
//! real kernel.
//!
//! This is where our cross-platform assumption is actually exercised: Linux
//! datagram sockets deliver ICMP replies without an IPv4 header while macOS
//! includes it, and `parse_auto` must decode both. It is `#[ignore]`d because
//! it needs a working ICMP datagram socket (on Linux that means
//! `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` must include the running user's gid). Run it
//! explicitly with `cargo test -- --ignored`.
